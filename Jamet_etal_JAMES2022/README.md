#  Non-local Eddy-Mean Kinetic Energy Transfers in Submesoscale-Permitting Ensemble Simulations

- The ```.py``` scripts are those used to make the figures in the manuscript.

- Data have been generated with the CDFTOOLS developped within this project, which can be found in [here](https://github.com/quentinjamet/CDFTOOLS/tree/cdf_medwest). Orignial code (to be compiled, cf CDFTOOLS instructions) are under ```./src``` and some examples of how to run those codes are provided under ```./run_cdftools```.

- The MEDWEST60 data set is stored on the GENCI-IDRIS [Jean-Zay](http://www.idris.fr/jean-zay/) supercomputer.
