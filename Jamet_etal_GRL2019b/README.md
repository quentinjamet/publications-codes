# Spatiotemporal Patterns of Chaos in the Atlantic Overturning Circulation

- The associated data can be found here: [http://ocean.fsu.edu/~qjamet/share/data/chaos_amoc_GRL2019/](http://ocean.fsu.edu/~qjamet/share/data/chaos_amoc_GRL2019/) (see the README file for a broader description)

- The scripts ```extr_amoc_yzt_ens.py``` and ```amoc_process.py``` are, respectively, used to compute the AMOC for each ensemble members from the raw model outputs, and time process them (see the manuscript for details on the time filtering procedure).
